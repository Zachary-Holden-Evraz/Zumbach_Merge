This program is made to merge specific data from several different .csv files into one main excel (.xlsx) file.
This program will repeat the above until there are no .csv files left.

if you cannot download the .exe file itself, download the zip files and use 7zip to extract them.

To run the macro:
Run the .exe file.  The program will ask the user to specify the excel file to update.  After this, the program will ask the user to give the 
directory where the .csv files reside.  Go to the folder where you have your csv files and copy the path from the top.  This is what you will input into the program.
Next, to start the macro, click on the start button on the small, separate window that is opened.  To stop the macro, click on the stop button.  Once the word "stopped"
is shown on the window, the program can be closed.

*** Warning: closing the program without using the stop button first may corrupt the excel file.
